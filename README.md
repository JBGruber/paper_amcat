# AmCAT 4: a toolkit for corpora storage, sharing and pre-processing

This repository contains the files for the paper *AmCAT 4: a toolkit for corpora storage, sharing and pre-processing*.
Since JOSS's submission guidelines require that the paper ["must be hosted in a Git-based repository together with your software"](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4r/tree/main/R), we added the parts of AmCAT as git submodules in this repository.
The packages will, however, not be updated here after we submit the paper.
Rather, development takes place in other repositories.
These are:

- `amcat4`: <https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4>
- `amcat4actioncat`: <https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4actioncat>
- `amcat4client`: <https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4client>
- `amcat4docker`: <https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4docker>
- `amcat4py`: <https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4py>
- `amcat4r`: <https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4r>
